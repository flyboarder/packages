// List manually adapted from https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/blob/master/src/index.js
//
// As of this writing, the latest version is 0.8.0, but VictoryLine won't work
// for any version after 0.6.1, so we stick with this version until that's
// fixed.
//
// This list should be good for a 0.7.0 release, should you want to make it. For
// 0.8.0 or later, the VictorySharedEvents entry should be uncommented at least.
